## Robotics Assignment 1: Rescue Line

This assignment is based upon the RoboCupJunior Rescue Line task. We were tasked to create a robot and program it to solve the following tasks:


1. Follow a 1-2 cm black line on a white paper background. The line the robot will follow have a variety of layouts and will be stress tested. 

2. Make a decision at a junction based on directions given. The outcome is based on coloured tape colours of black, green and red. (Img)

3. It will navigate around an obstacle of unspecified dimensions on the track, and find the black line on the other side of the obstacle.

4. It must cope with path-following when there is a gap in the path.

Details of the code can be found within the src folder.
