## Data Stuctures and Algorithms

In this module I undertook various assignments based on manipulation of a number of data structures such as Lists, Maps, Sets, Queues, Stacks, and Arrays. 

I apply them to perform file handling, implement various algorithms (Dijkstra's, Merge Sort, Depth/Breath First sort, etc...). I was also introduced to writing proper JUnit test within assignment works.

Assignment 1: To program a drone to explore an underground world and map out the maze formed by the chambers and connections between them and then find a way back efficiently.

Assignment 2: I work with priority queues, ext merge sorting, CSV files and file handling.

Assignment 3: This assignment is about manipulating graphs and implementing Dijkstra's algorithm to find the distance between 2 nodes in the graphs.
